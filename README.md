# Overview
Foody Moody, aka the SCV Restaurant Mood Finder, is a dynamic web application built with React that helps users discover restaurants in the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV) based on their current mood and preferred cuisines. Leveraging the power of the Yelp API, this application offers a user-friendly interface to explore a variety of dining options tailored to specific feelings and culinary interests. Submitted to the Congressional App Challenge 2022.

# Features
### Mood-Based Restaurant Discovery:
Users can select their current mood from a predefined list (e.g., Happy, Tired, Adventurous) to receive restaurant recommendations that match their emotional state.
### Cuisine Filtering:
Users can further refine their search based on different cuisines, such as Italian, Chinese, or Mexican, ensuring they find the perfect dining experience.
### Interactive User Interface:
A clean and intuitive design built with React provides a seamless and engaging user experience.
### Real-Time Data:
Integration with the Yelp API ensures up-to-date restaurant information, including ratings, reviews, and location.

# Technologies Used
### React:
For building the responsive and interactive user interface.
### Yelp API: 
To fetch real-time data about restaurants, including details like ratings, reviews, and addresses.
### Postman:

# How It Works
### Mood Selection:
Users start by selecting their mood from a list. Each mood category is associated with specific restaurant types or styles. I filtered keywords in the data that specifically correlated to each mood.
### Cuisine Choice:
Users can choose from a variety of cuisines or search any keywords to further tailor their restaurant search.
### Results Display:
The application sends a request to the Yelp API based on the selected mood and cuisine, then displays a list of recommended restaurants, including their ratings, reviews, and locations. The queries are clickable and will take the user to the Yelp page if selected.
